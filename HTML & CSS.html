        div {
            height: 200px; Uses pixels. Static size.
            width: 200px; Uses pixels. Static size.

<!-- CSS Box Model -->

        4 layers of the box model:
    
            margin - pushes outwards
                border - pushes inwards
                    padding - pushes inwards
                        content - pushes inwards
            
            Margin 
            The space between the element and other elements. Starts at border and pushes outward.

            Border 
            The border of the element. Starts at outside of border and thickens border going inward.

            Padding 
            The space between the border of the element and the content. Starts at border and pushes inwards toward content.

            Content 
            Any text, image, or elements inside the element.

        Example:

        <div class="main-article">
        </div>

        .main-article {
            border: 10px blue dotted;
            padding: 10px 2px 10px 2px;

            li:nth-child(2){
            }
        Starts at beginning of li tags and styles every other one. (Would be good for zebra striping for example)
            li:nth-child(2n <!-- 2n is every other so 3n would be every 3rd --> + 1 <!-- Where we start, so the first li tag in this case -->){
            }
